Using  Flash or going into  stasis (i.e  Zhonya's Hourglass,  Guardian Angel) will cancel the animation but the attack will still land.\n Can be used while  grounded or  rooted. If Illaoi attack commands and then casts Harsh Lesson, she will use the close range Harsh Lesson even if the target is beyond her melee range.\n Starting the attack before triggering  Guardian Angel's passive and hitting while she's in it will not cause the Tentacles to slam.\n Starting the attack before the target becomes  untargetable will still cause the Tentacles to slam the target.\n Does trigger  Hail of Blades.\n Triggers  Energized effects on-hit.\n Using it at the same time with  Ravenous Hydra will perform an unusual dunk.\n If the empowered attack duration ends during the attack animation, the attack won't be empowered.\n\n The dash range ability:\n Is not unstoppable, meaning that effects can interrupt it during the dash and put it cooldown.  Flash and  Zhonya's Hourglass cannot be used during the dash.\n Cannot be used while  grounded or  rooted.\n Starting the attack before the target becomes  untargetable will not make Tentacles slam.\n Does not trigger  Hail of Blades.\n Triggers  Energized effects on-jump.\n Having enough attack speed will perform an unusual dunk.\n Having increased size will increase the range of her Harsh Lesson but the indicator range will not change.\n If the empowered attack duration ends during the dash, the buff will linger until the attack has finished.\n\n  Spell shields will block the bonus damage but will not prevent the Tentacle slam, unless a dash range Harsh Lesson has been used, in which case the bonus damage is not blocked but the spell shield is still consumed.\n Parries ( Counter Strike,  Spirit's Refuge,  Blinding Dart) will block the damage and will not trigger  Tentacle slams, with the exception of:\n  Spirit's Refuge when using a close range Harsh Lesson, which triggers  Tentacle slams.\n  Blinding Dart when using a dash range Harsh Lesson, which triggers  Tentacle slams.\n\n If the target dies at the moment Harsh Lesson hits the target, it will be consumed and put on cooldown, without making Tentacles slam.\n The Tentacle attacking because of Harsh Lesson is considered to be part of it, and thus will not grant additional stacks of  Conqueror,  Electrocute,  Phase Rush and Tribute.\n Using it together with  Dead Man's Plate will grant an additional stack of  Conqueror.\n Harsh Lesson's bonus damage applies before  Blade of the Ruined King's damage.\n Harsh Lesson triggers  Bone Plating and one of its plates with the same attack.\n Attack moving while charging  Hexflash will delay the attack.",
