A unit that went below 50% health while Warwick was dead and has not taken damage while he is alive will not be detected by Blood Hunt until it falls low again.\n Same applies to enemy champions that went under the threshold by taking Nexus Obelisk damage or to units that spawn with their current health below the threshold (i.e  Hallucinate,  Mirror Image).\n\n The detection from Blood Hunt is more similar to  Tremor Sense than a form of sight - it grants positional information only.

The first hit deals 2/9 of the total damage and triggers the on-hit effects once while the second hit deals 1/9 of it.\n The healing is increased by  life steal.\n If Warwick does not collide with a champion, he will slide a fixed distance past the maximum range during which he is  disarmed and unable to cast movement abilities, including  Flash, but being able to cast  Jaws of the Beast and  Blood Hunt, with the former also interrupting the slide.\n Warwick is able to cast  Primal Howl at any time during the leap.",
