For  critical strikes, 18 fire bolts are launched instead. This does not occur if the initial damage of Moonlight Vigil kills the target.\n With  Crescendum, 1 spectral chakram is gained for every target hit by the blast, meaning it is possible to gain up to 8 spectral chakrams with one use of Moonlight Vigil if it hits 5 enemy champions.\n PENDING FOR TEST: Champion decoys count for this interaction.\n\n With  Severum, the extra flat heal is given only once, not per target.

The time before being able to reactivate Ranger's Focus is 6.08 \u2212 1.6 (based on attack speed) seconds.\n The multi-attack effect is similar to  Lightslinger and  Double Strike, except that on-hit effects aren't applied by the extra attacks.\n Each arrow from a flurry applies  Frost and the bonus damage from  Frost Shot is calculated individually per arrow.\n Similarly, since a flurry is 5 instances of physical damage,  The Black Cleaver allows her to cleave the enemy target 5 times per flurry.\n  Amumu's  Tantrum will reduce each arrow's damage, for a total of 10 \u2212 50 (based on E Rank) per flurry.\n\n Each additional arrow from  Runaan's Hurricane will also split into 5 arrows.\n The arrows are evenly distributed among secondary enemies but one enemy cannot be hit by more than 5 arrows.\n The flurry will trigger on-hit effects once to each enemy hit.\n Wind's Fury's splash damage is affected by the damage modifier of Ranger's Focus Rank 1 and doesn't increase based on its Rank - always dealing[ (8.4% AD) damage per arrow ][ (42% AD) damage per flurry ]to each secondary target.\n\n The Flurry attack can be used on structures.",

It's travel time varies between ~0.65 at point blank and ~1.8 at max range, resulting in an overall delay of ~1.2-2.4 seconds depending on distance covered.\n This ability can only be blocked by an enemy's  spell shield. Allies will be put in  stasis no matter what they do.",

Those coming from behind will not be affected.\n Projectiles: Sped up entities not classified as a unit (champions, minions, monsters, etc.)\n Intercepting: A projectile hits Braum because he stands in front of the intended target. In addition to being redirected, an intercepted projectile is also destroyed after hitting Braum (although this is only applicable to pass-through projectiles)\n\n Moving units are not intercepted under any circumstance, including  dashes. Champion-summoned units ( Command: Attack,  Sapling Toss, etc.) are not classified as units until they hit the ground and thus will interact with Unbreakable while en route.\n Projectiles whose effects trigger on collision will still trigger - dealing damage, applying debuffs, creating slowing fields and marking the target as 'hit' for the purposes of  Zenith Blade's dash or  Infected Cleaver's health refund.\n Abilities that deal area of effect damage on-collision will only damage Braum.\n If  Spinning Axe hits Braum, regardless if it's the first hit on the damage reduction or not, it will always bounce back and not be destroyed. This happens even if Braum intercepts the attack for an ally though the axe will bounce back from Braum and not the intended target.\n Projectile-based ground-targeted abilities that only occur upon successfully hitting the ground ( Miasma,  Aqua Prison, etc.) will apply their full effects to Braum but will be destroyed without affecting any other ally.\n Projectiles that cannot hit Braum or his allies (such as an enemy  Prismatic Barrier) will not be intercepted.[2]\n  Soraka's  Starcall's Rejuvenation projectile is however blocked.\n\n The damage reduction will affect any source of damage whose origin is in front of the shield. This includes...\n All intercepted projectiles.\n Melee and non-projectile-based ranged attacks.\n Instantaneous skillshots ( Final Spark,  Lifeform Disintegration Ray, etc.)\n Instantaneously-placed ground-targeted abilities ( Lay Waste,  Rupture, etc.) relative to the ability's center and not the caster's\n Point-blank areas-of-effect ( Tantrum,  Time Bomb not targeted at Braum, etc.)\n\n Instantaneous targeted abilities ( Transfusion,  Time Bomb targeted at Braum, etc.) and  AoE DoT ( Tormented Shadow,  Poison Trail) do not interact with Unbreakable.\n The damage reduction only benefits Braum.\n If  Audacious Charge would path  Xin Zhao through Unbreakable, only Braum will take reduced damage.\n\n  Damage over time is calculated per tick but be aware the full damage reduction will only apply to a single tick.\n If the damage mitigated by Unbreakable exceeds a minimum threshold it is represented with floating text similar to the damage mitigated by shields ('-X')\n This floating text is always shown for the single fully-reduced damage source.\n\n For the purposes of abilities like  Backstab Braum's facing direction is the direction he's moving in (not the direction his face or the shield are looking in)\n This is a documented game engine limitation.\n\n If Braum is protected by a  spell shield, both it and the one-time-use full damage reduction can be consumed by a single blockable spell.\n The one-time-use full damage reduction will not be consumed if the damage source is nothing but  true damage.\n\n Unbreakable will grant assist credit if the enemy who's projectile is blocked from is killed within 10 seconds.",

This is a visual bug, and his attack speed behaves normally.\n His reload speed is in the form of reloads per second:\n Graves' bonus attack speed growth and the cap affect his reload speed, making his bonus attack speed more worth after each level.\n Reload speed: Scales less the more attack speed you have until 150% bonus attack speed (not included growth). Going over that will decrease the reload speed until capping at 200% bonus attack speed.\n The  reload time after firing both shells and the time before reloading while sitting on one shell are the same, of 2.08 seconds. They're then reduced by bonus attack speed, to a minimum of 1.54 \u2212 1.12 (based on level) seconds.\n Reload speed at 150% bonus attack speed: 0.651 \u2212  0.891 (based on level).\n\n\n The reload time with one shell is 1.3 seconds.\n On-hit effects have a variety of interactions with New Destiny:\n Charge based on-hit effects like Energized or cooldown based on-hit effects like Spellblade will apply to the first target hit, and are not guaranteed to affect his attack target.\n On-Action Effects such as  Help, Pix! and  Runaan's Hurricane will be triggered, and still obey their standard target-acquisition rules. Wind's Fury can select secondary targets that are also damaged by Graves' attacks.\n  Guinsoo's Rageblade will affect all enemies hit, applying on-hit effects twice to each of them.\n  The Black Cleaver will apply 1 stack to the enemy each individual pellet hits, stacking multiple times if multiple pellets hit the same target.\n\n  Randuin's Omen's critical damage reduction will apply to every pellet.\n Given the right circumstances pellets can go around and beyond the intended target thus damaging other enemies.\n If Graves is  blinded pellets will fly (still in a cone) in a random direction (excluding his target's) but he can still damage nearby enemy units hit by pellets.\n\n Structures will intercept and be hit by multiple pellets, as with other valid targets.\n Units that take modified damage ( wards) can only be damaged by one pellet per attack and will not intercept additional ones.",

Using  Flash or going into  stasis (i.e  Zhonya's Hourglass,  Guardian Angel) will cancel the animation but the attack will still land.\n Can be used while  grounded or  rooted. If Illaoi attack commands and then casts Harsh Lesson, she will use the close range Harsh Lesson even if the target is beyond her melee range.\n Starting the attack before triggering  Guardian Angel's passive and hitting while she's in it will not cause the Tentacles to slam.\n Starting the attack before the target becomes  untargetable will still cause the Tentacles to slam the target.\n Does trigger  Hail of Blades.\n Triggers  Energized effects on-hit.\n Using it at the same time with  Ravenous Hydra will perform an unusual dunk.\n If the empowered attack duration ends during the attack animation, the attack won't be empowered.\n\n The dash range ability:\n Is not unstoppable, meaning that effects can interrupt it during the dash and put it cooldown.  Flash and  Zhonya's Hourglass cannot be used during the dash.\n Cannot be used while  grounded or  rooted.\n Starting the attack before the target becomes  untargetable will not make Tentacles slam.\n Does not trigger  Hail of Blades.\n Triggers  Energized effects on-jump.\n Having enough attack speed will perform an unusual dunk.\n Having increased size will increase the range of her Harsh Lesson but the indicator range will not change.\n If the empowered attack duration ends during the dash, the buff will linger until the attack has finished.\n\n  Spell shields will block the bonus damage but will not prevent the Tentacle slam, unless a dash range Harsh Lesson has been used, in which case the bonus damage is not blocked but the spell shield is still consumed.\n Parries ( Counter Strike,  Spirit's Refuge,  Blinding Dart) will block the damage and will not trigger  Tentacle slams, with the exception of:\n  Spirit's Refuge when using a close range Harsh Lesson, which triggers  Tentacle slams.\n  Blinding Dart when using a dash range Harsh Lesson, which triggers  Tentacle slams.\n\n If the target dies at the moment Harsh Lesson hits the target, it will be consumed and put on cooldown, without making Tentacles slam.\n The Tentacle attacking because of Harsh Lesson is considered to be part of it, and thus will not grant additional stacks of  Conqueror,  Electrocute,  Phase Rush and Tribute.\n Using it together with  Dead Man's Plate will grant an additional stack of  Conqueror.\n Harsh Lesson's bonus damage applies before  Blade of the Ruined King's damage.\n Harsh Lesson triggers  Bone Plating and one of its plates with the same attack.\n Attack moving while charging  Hexflash will delay the attack.",

As per above, the damage is still dependent on the Spirit's and Vessel's damage modifiers and may not always be able to deal 100% of the target's current health as total redirected damage.\n The damage displayed as being received by the Spirit is not representative of the damage redirected to the Vessel, as the combat text shown adjacent to the Spirit uses the Spirit's resistances.\n\n  Spell shields may only prevent the initial spirit grab and the slow upon becoming a Vessel. Spell shields will not prevent becoming a Vessel or Tentacles from attacking.\n The spirit pull is not considered a  crowd control effect and will not be blocked by cc-immune effects, with the exception of  Morgana's  Black Shield.\n If the target becomes a Vessel within range of a dormant Tentacle, that Tentacle will skip its first attack.\n The tentacle model of the first cast is connected to Illaoi's body and will stop moving when Illaoi does (e.g  stasis,  sleep,  airborne). However, the projectile will not, and will be able to hit enemies away from its model position. It will also not be seen by enemies if Illaoi is not  visible, but it will be heard if the tentacle passes through their vision. \n Using  Flash during the cast time will change Illaoi's position but the tentacle will still be directed towards the previous pointed location.\n Grabbing the Spirit of a champion that has their resource bar white (i.e  Flow) will make the Spirit's lifetime (the white bar below the lifebar) disappear.\n Grabbing the Spirit of a target that is  camouflaged while there\u2019s a control ward revealing them will make the Spirit invisible.\n Only Illaoi can see who's been Vesseled, with their model covered in watery effects. The Vessel itself will instead have its screen covered in watery effects.\n If the enemy champion is reviving when the conditions for becoming a Vessel are met, then they will not revive as a Vessel.\n Runes consider the Spirit as a champion for their effects and stat-tracking.\n  Predator only reflects double bonus damage, not taking into account actual damage done to the Spirit (e.g if  Predator would deal 60 bonus damage, what would get reflected is 120 damage).\n\n Transferred damage will apply on-damage effects, such as  The Black Cleaver,  Morellonomicon,  Executioner's Calling,  Aspect of the Dragon burn damage and the healing from  Death's Dance or  Hextech Gunblade.\n Transferred damage will not doubly apply on-hit or on-spell effects versus the target (e.g.  Liandry's Torment,  Phase Rush stacks). These effects are only applied versus the Spirit.\n Attacking the Vessel and its Spirit simultaneously will only apply one  The Black Cleaver to the Vessel.\n\n Once the Spirit vanishes, whether defeated or not, Illaoi will get  Rage's full movement speed bonus and 1 creep score in-game (not included in the post-game counter).\n The Spirit is immune to  stasis (i.e.  Bard's  Tempered Fate).\n  Fiora's  Riposte can be used to prevent becoming a Vessel if used before the Spirit is killed or while leaving the tether's range.\n  Sion's Spirit cannot be spawned during  Glory in Death.

However, the projectile will not, and will be able to hit enemies away from its model position. It will also not be seen by enemies if Illaoi is not  visible, but it will be heard if the tentacle passes through their vision. \n Using  Flash during the cast time will change Illaoi's position but the tentacle will still be directed towards the previous pointed location.\n Grabbing the Spirit of a champion that has their resource bar white (i.e  Flow) will make the Spirit's lifetime (the white bar below the lifebar) disappear.\n Grabbing the Spirit of a target that is  camouflaged while there\u2019s a control ward revealing them will make the Spirit invisible.\n Only Illaoi can see who's been Vesseled, with their model covered in watery effects. The Vessel itself will instead have its screen covered in watery effects.\n If the enemy champion is reviving when the conditions for becoming a Vessel are met, then they will not revive as a Vessel.\n Runes consider the Spirit as a champion for their effects and stat-tracking.\n  Predator only reflects double bonus damage, not taking into account actual damage done to the Spirit (e.g if  Predator would deal 60 bonus damage, what would get reflected is 120 damage).\n\n Transferred damage will apply on-damage effects, such as  The Black Cleaver,  Morellonomicon,  Executioner's Calling,  Aspect of the Dragon burn damage and the healing from  Death's Dance or  Hextech Gunblade.\n Transferred damage will not doubly apply on-hit or on-spell effects versus the target (e.g.  Liandry's Torment,  Phase Rush stacks). These effects are only applied versus the Spirit.\n Attacking the Vessel and its Spirit simultaneously will only apply one  The Black Cleaver to the Vessel.\n\n Once the Spirit vanishes, whether defeated or not, Illaoi will get  Rage's full movement speed bonus and 1 creep score in-game (not included in the post-game counter).\n The Spirit is immune to  stasis (i.e.  Bard's  Tempered Fate).\n  Fiora's  Riposte can be used to prevent becoming a Vessel if used before the Spirit is killed or while leaving the tether's range.\n  Sion's Spirit cannot be spawned during  Glory in Death. Spirits created before Sion's undeath will remain active.",

Mordekaiser will still get the usual amount of maximum health.\n The boundaries are not considered terrain ( exception), but enemies that try to move out of the area will be displaced back inside. \n Abilities such as  Comet of Legend and  Keeper's Verdict will cap their effect range to the boundary. Targets will stop at the boundary even after it expired.\n\n Multiple Death Realms spawned will exist in the same dimension, allowing champions to see and interact with champions bound to other circles. Champions are only affected by their boundaries and are not able to see the others.\n  Tahm Kench's  Devour can carry a target outside of their circle, but they will be displaced back inside once  Regurgitated. \n An active  Assault and Battery on a target outside the perimeter will cause  Vi to continue her charge until her circle ends. She can knockback and damage secondary targets multiple times.\n\n The transition in and out of the Death Realm doesn't interrupt channels and doesn't affect the target's commands. Being in Death Realm can be dispelled if:\n The target uses  Quicksilver Sash or abilities with cc-removals.\n Mordekaiser or the target cast another Realm of Death. The affected champions will remain stuck for the duration of the new circle.\n\n Tether effects will break upon entering the dimension, unless it is between the two champions entering the dimension.\n Structures exist in all realms at the same time, and  turrets will target normally as if all units were in the same realm.\n Effects interactions:\n  The Hextech Ultimatum, catching a  Spinning Axe,  Timewinder,  Null Zone,  Twisted Advance,  Worked Grounds,  Gravity Field,  Satchel Charge,  Rift Scuttler's  Speed Shrine,  Statikk Shiv and gaining  Zeke's Convergence  area of effect are exceptions and may still take effect between dimensions.\n Effects such as  Requiem,  Absolute Zero,  Grand Starfall and  Final Spark will only deal damage to enemies of the dimension they're in at time of cast. Ending the channel or cast time while inside another dimension will not do damage to nearby enemies.\n  Shuriken Flip may be re-cast inside the Death Realm even if its target is outside it, but  Akali will stop dashing upon colliding with the boundary.\n  Fear Beyond Death may not be re-cast while his victim is not in the same realm as him, but an already chained foe will still continue to be reeled in and executed. The  fear is cast in the realm Urgot is in.\n  Void Shift dispels from Realm of Death's slow, making it vulnerable to the Death Realm.\n  Ball will instantly return back to her if she's in another dimension.\n Controllable pets and decoys are still controllable between realms.\n\n PENDING FOR TEST:\n  Tahm Kench  Devours the target affected by Death Realm before it ends.\n\n The  nearsight from  Nocturne's  Paranoia does not affect a target\u2019s  sight radius while in the Death Realm.\n Unless Mordekaiser and  Nocturne are in the same dimension.",

This takes 6 increments to reach the Total MS + 85, but may take more to reach the Uncapped Flat + 85. Due to flat bonuses increasing the time threshold, it is possible for the ability's effects to end before reaching the total uncapped movement speed. \n If Nunu turns continuously he will create a 600 unit circle, increased with bonus movement speed, striking the same point up to 3 times, for a maximum of 180 / 225 / 270 / 315 / 360 (+ 300% AP) magic damage. The damage can be further increased by detonating the snowball, for a total of 360 / 450 / 540 / 630 / 720 (+450% AP) magic damage.\n  Ryze's  Realm Warp will only teleport Nunu and Willump, leaving the  snowball behind.\n Hovering the cursor on the HUD (e.g minimap / champion portraits) does not affect the cast and steering of Biggest Snowball Ever!.",

The fact that they're struck is considered basic attacked once by Senna was the reason damage came out.\n This may be confirmed by that the damage follows the rule of Ability Power damage conversion\n Also this implements that the damage is not as described in this skill, but is same with a basic attack to  Turrets from Senna.\n\n On-hit effects are applied in order of struck units' spawn ID. This matters for effects that are consumed on-hit (E.g.  Duskblade of Draktharr, Spellblade), which are applied to the target with the lowest Spawn ID.\n \"spawn ID\" is an unofficial abbreviation to describe the spawn order for all units at the beginning of games, below are some examples.\n If Senna targets an enemy champion but hits at least one more enemy champion simultaneously,  Press the Attack's first stack will be applied to that target. If no champion was targeted, it will default to the champion with the lowest Spawn ID out of the ones struck by the ability. Whether the effect stacks up on a champion or not when multiple enemy champions are stuck also depends on Spawn ID.\n IF Piercing Darkness struck an enemy champion and turret simultaneously, with  Rapid Firecannon fully charged,  Rapid Firecannon's effect will most likely proc on the turret since turrets are often spawned before champions.",

However, 'Cloak of Mist' has the unspecified effect of negating the obscuring effects of 'Wraith Form' (i.e. you're not a wraith while inside the mist); you have the bonus movement speed even when you're not a wraith (e.g. inside the mist or an enemy is nearby); and 'Wraith Form' also grants the functionality of camouflage (i.e. you are treated as a camouflaged unit with regards to turret vision and  Control Wards). \n Given this overly complex interaction between the two buffs granted as well as the overlapping effects, it is easier to describe the effects as a single buff that is modified in specific circumstances rather than trying to establish a new game mechanic. \n Senna likewise has her aura buff and the 'Wraith Form' buff, but her 'Wraith Form' does not share gameplay functionality with other allies benefiting from Wraith Form. For Senna, the appearance of being a wraith is a form-swap while camouflaged (similar to  Evelynn's  Demon Shade). Senna will remain in her wraith form when she is detected so long as the camouflage effect isn't broken, and her wraith's appearance is very distinct from other wraiths.\n\n  Oracle's Extract has no effect on champions with the Cloak of Mist buff, even though Oracle's Extract has a range of 500, while the camouflage radius is only 280 or 400 in the case of Senna herself.",

When it has ended, he will revive instantly, which can result in some odd interactions and bugs at times.\n\n Glory in Death does not trigger on clones of Sion, such as with  Test of Spirit.\n Upon death, Sion will drop 'most' non-permanent buffs and debuffs before transitioning into Glory in Death. These effects include undisplayed statuses, for example the 'already stunned by this'-flag of  Veigar's  Event Horizon or  Viktor's  Gravity Field.\n Sion's transition will not remove effects that presist through death, such as  Brand's  Blaze.\n\n All projectiles targeting Sion are destroyed at the start of becoming  untargetable.\n Projectiles created after the fact will still travel to Sion, but only affect him if he's no longer untargetable.\n\n If a projectile is targeting Sion at the end of Glory in Death and he revives instantly, it will not be destroyed.\n At the start of Glory in Death, Sion's mana drops to 0, but will still be affected by mana restoration.\n During Glory in Death Sion: \n Has all sources of self-healing other than  life steal and  spell vamp reduced by 100%.\n This includes item passives such as  Hextech Gunblade and  Blade of the Ruined King's special lifesteal-affected on-hit, as well as runes such as  Ravenous Hunter.\n  Spirit Visage's unique passive is unaffected and furthermore 'lowers' this reduction to 70% due to the way it factors in.\n\n Can  critically strike, but will use no special animation and no special sound effect.\n Can use item actives.\n Cannot use summoner spells.\n Cannot take  Dark Passage.\n Cannot be targeted by  Devour.\n Can use  Magical Journey.\n Cannot be  banished to the  Realm of Death.\n\n Sion's attack speed during Glory in Death is fixed at 1.75 and it's unaffected by attack speed slows/buffs for the duration.\n Buffs that allow for the normal 2.5 attack speed cap to be broken, such as  Lethal Tempo and  Hail of Blades, will also break the upper limit of the 1.75 cap, but not the lower one. This means that while these buffs are active, Sion can exceed 1.75 attack speed, but cannot fall below it.\n After the effect ends, the attack speed cap will not revert to 1.75 but to 2.5. However Sion will still not be able to go below 1.75 attack speed.\n\n Buffs from jungle monsters Sion gains during Glory in Death ( Crest of Cinders,  Crest of Insight) will not be lost once the duration ends.\n By surviving for the full duration of 60 seconds, Sion will suffer 36.4k \u2212 345.5k (based on level) self-damage.\n After Glory in Death ends, the corpse of Sion will retain body block despite being dead on the ground.\n Even though its visuals are present,  Dark Harvest can never be gained from Sion under the effect of Glory in Death.\n Sion cannot  Recall while under the effect of Glory in Death.\n The effect that heals Sion back to full health at the start of Glory in Death cannot be modified by  healing reductions and does not count towards the 'Damage Healed' statistic at the end of game lobby.",

After this, it becomes noticeable only if it hits an enemy, since the visual and sound effects are played on-target. None of the VFX/SFX are noticeable when you do not have  vision of it.\n\n Forced movement without a  stun component like  Spectral Cutlass (or the stun being  cleansed previously) will not stop Sion from starting or continuing to channel. Its direction will not change with Sion's travel, however the location will update with him.\n The location of the indicator updates at the beginning of the ability, at 1 second and at release.\n\n The hitbox of the ability is center-to-center, but goes slightly beyond the indicator at its front.

          "notes": "If Sylas casts Hijack on a decoy, no ultimate is stolen and the ability will be placed on a full cooldown.\n If the stolen ability is on-target and it loses its target during the cast time (i.e  untargetability, loss of  vision) the ability will cancel and go on cooldown.\n Since the copied ability scales based on Hijack's rank, abilities can be copied regardless of their rank.\n Hijack will copy all components of the ability: passives and actives as well as recast effects. Hijack will not trigger the effects of other abilities unless absolutely necessary. \n Shape-shifting ultimates will transform Sylas into the target's alternate form, replacing his basic abilities and base stats. Namely:  Cougar Form,  Spider Form,  Cannon Form and  Dragon Form.\n Dragon's Descent refreshes Sylas's mana, depleting it and regenerating it at the same rate Shyvana's  fury would. Other sources of mana restoration will extend the duration as well. At the end of the effect, Sylas gains his previous mana. \n Permanent transformations last for ~5 minutes or until toggled off. \n The alternate abilities of transforming champions will cost mana and scale with the ranks as appropriate for the ability (e.g. ranks in R for Nidalee and ranks in Q/W/E for Jayce/Elise).\n Upon transforming, a  Petricite Burst stack will be deducted.\n  Petricite Burst stacks will still be gained from abilities cast in alternate forms, but the stacks are gained independently from the normal ones. Each transformed stack applies an additional on-hit effect.\n If Sylas has both normal and transformed stacks, Petricite Burst will prioritize consuming Sylas stacks before the transformed ones.\n\n\n Ultimates comply with One For All rules if an ally is playing the hijacked champion. For example, an allied  Darius'  Hemorrhage stacks will increase the damage of the hijacked Noxian Guillotine; or an allied  Syndra's  Dark Sphere will add extra damage to hijacked Unleashed Power as well as producing 3 spheres that she can use.\n\nInteractions\n\n  Amumu's  Curse of the Sad Mummy - Does not apply  Cursed Touch.\n  Aphelios'  Moonlight Vigil - Based on the  main weapon at the moment of steal.  Crescendum empowers his basic attacks temporarily.\n  Calibrum does not apply marks.\n\n  Brand's  Pyroclasm - Does not apply stacks of  Blaze.\n  Cho'Gath's  Feast - Gains permanent Feast charges on-kill.\n  Corki's  Missile Barrage - Gains max charges. \n  Darius'  Noxian Guillotine - Deals minimal damage and does not apply stacks of  Hemorrhage.\n  Fiora's  Grand Challenge - Gains movement speed in the effect and can trigger the area healing, but  Vitals do not deal bonus damage.\n  Gangplank's  Cannon Barrage - Does not steal cannon upgrades.\n  Gnar's  GNAR! - Gains a usable ultimate regardless of cast on  Mini Gnar or  Mega Gnar.\n  Heimerdinger's  UPGRADE!!! - Sylas's basic abilities are replaced with Heimerdinger's empowered abilities.\n  Illaoi's  Leap of Faith - Does not reduce  cooldown of  Kingslayer.\n  Kassadin's  Riftwalk - Only provides one use.\n  Kai'Sa's  Killer Instinct - Sylas' basic attacks,  Abduct and nearby allies'  immobilizations apply stacks of  Plasma, up to 4. Sylas is unable to apply the 5th stack necessary to expunge the stacks.\n  Kalista's  Fate's Call - Only castable with a  link (purchasable in the Shop for  0 gold).\n  Karma's  Mantra - Sylas's basic abilities are replaced with Karma's empowered abilities.\n  Kayn's  Umbral Trespass - Based on current form ( Shadow Assassin/ Rhaast).\n  Kha'Zix's  Void Assault - Can steal the ability's  evolution bonus effects.\n  Kennen's  Slicing Maelstrom - Does not apply  Mark of the Storm, targets are not  stunned.\n  Kled's  Chaaaaaaaarge!!! - Does not need  mount to cast.\n  Kog'Maw's  Living Artillery - Only provides one use.\n  LeBlanc's  Mimic - Uses the empowered version of  LeBlanc's last cast basic ability. If she has not cast any spells,  Mimic Sigil of Malice is copied.\n  Leona's  Solar Flare - Does not apply  Sunlight.\n  Master Yi's  Highlander - Kills do not reduce basic ability cooldowns.\n  Mordekaiser's  Realm of Death - Can join the dimension of outgoing realms if cast in the proper range (does not extend their duration).\n  Nasus'  Fury of the Sands - Does not reduce  cooldown of  Chain Lash.\n  Orianna's  Command: Shockwave - Cast on self without a  ball.\n  Rengar's  Thrill of the Hunt - Sylas will gain  Unseen Predator on his next attack.\n  Sylas'  Hijack - Steals the ability that the enemy Sylas has stolen. Cannot be targeted if no ability has been stolen.\n  Rek'Sai's  Void Rush - Sylas's attacks against enemy champions will apply a  mark which can be used to cast Void Rush.\n  Syndra's  Unleashed Power - Throws a minimum of 3  spheres, which are left on the ground afterwards and vanish after 6 seconds.\n  Talon's  Shadow Assault - Does not apply  Blade's End.\n  Teemo's  Noxious Trap - Gains max charges.\n  Twitch's  Spray and Pray - Gains 300 attack range and his attacks produce missiles that travel 850 range. These attacks are classified as  melee, and so will trigger effects such as  Tiamat versus all hit targets.\n  Udyr - Steals  Phoenix Stance. Lasts for 2 empowered attacks. \n  Varus'  Chain of Corruption - Does not apply stacks of  Blight.\n  Vayne's  Final Hour - Gains the AD and MS bonuses.

The first hit deals 2/9 of the total damage and triggers the on-hit effects once while the second hit deals 1/9 of it.\n The healing is increased by  life steal.\n If Warwick does not collide with a champion, he will slide a fixed distance past the maximum range during which he is  disarmed and unable to cast movement abilities, including  Flash, but being able to cast  Jaws of the Beast and  Blood Hunt, with the former also interrupting the slide.\n Warwick is able to cast  Primal Howl at any time during the leap.",
