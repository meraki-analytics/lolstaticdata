        "notes": "If Sylas casts Hijack on a decoy, no ultimate is stolen and the ability will be placed on a full cooldown.\n If the stolen ability is on-target and it loses its target during the cast time (i.e  untargetability, loss of  vision) the ability will cancel and go on cooldown.\n Since the copied ability scales based on Hijack's rank, abilities can be copied regardless of their rank.\n Hijack will copy all components of the ability: passives and actives as well as recast effects. Hijack will not trigger the effects of other abilities unless absolutely necessary. \n Shape-shifting ultimates will transform Sylas into the target's alternate form, replacing his basic abilities and base stats. Namely:  Cougar Form,  Spider Form,  Cannon Form and  Dragon Form.\n Dragon's Descent refreshes Sylas's mana, depleting it and regenerating it at the same rate Shyvana's  fury would. Other sources of mana restoration will extend the duration as well. At the end of the effect, Sylas gains his previous mana. \n Permanent transformations last for ~5 minutes or until toggled off. \n The alternate abilities of transforming champions will cost mana and scale with the ranks as appropriate for the ability (e.g. ranks in R for Nidalee and ranks in Q/W/E for Jayce/Elise).\n Upon transforming, a  Petricite Burst stack will be deducted.\n  Petricite Burst stacks will still be gained from abilities cast in alternate forms, but the stacks are gained independently from the normal ones. Each transformed stack applies an additional on-hit effect.\n If Sylas has both normal and transformed stacks, Petricite Burst will prioritize consuming Sylas stacks before the transformed ones.\n\n\n Ultimates comply with One For All rules if an ally is playing the hijacked champion. For example, an allied  Darius'  Hemorrhage stacks will increase the damage of the hijacked Noxian Guillotine; or an allied  Syndra's  Dark Sphere will add extra damage to hijacked Unleashed Power as well as producing 3 spheres that she can use.\n\nInteractions\n\n  Amumu's  Curse of the Sad Mummy - Does not apply  Cursed Touch.\n  Aphelios'  Moonlight Vigil - Based on the  main weapon at the moment of steal.
