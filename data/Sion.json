When it has ended, he will revive instantly, which can result in some odd interactions and bugs at times.\n\n Glory in Death does not trigger on clones of Sion, such as with  Test of Spirit.\n Upon death, Sion will drop 'most' non-permanent buffs and debuffs before transitioning into Glory in Death. These effects include undisplayed statuses, for example the 'already stunned by this'-flag of  Veigar's  Event Horizon or  Viktor's  Gravity Field.\n Sion's transition will not remove effects that presist through death, such as  Brand's  Blaze.\n\n All projectiles targeting Sion are destroyed at the start of becoming  untargetable.\n Projectiles created after the fact will still travel to Sion, but only affect him if he's no longer untargetable.\n\n If a projectile is targeting Sion at the end of Glory in Death and he revives instantly, it will not be destroyed.\n At the start of Glory in Death, Sion's mana drops to 0, but will still be affected by mana restoration.\n During Glory in Death Sion: \n Has all sources of self-healing other than  life steal and  spell vamp reduced by 100%.\n This includes item passives such as  Hextech Gunblade and  Blade of the Ruined King's special lifesteal-affected on-hit, as well as runes such as  Ravenous Hunter.\n  Spirit Visage's unique passive is unaffected and furthermore 'lowers' this reduction to 70% due to the way it factors in.\n\n Can  critically strike, but will use no special animation and no special sound effect.\n Can use item actives.\n Cannot use summoner spells.\n Cannot take  Dark Passage.\n Cannot be targeted by  Devour.\n Can use  Magical Journey.\n Cannot be  banished to the  Realm of Death.\n\n Sion's attack speed during Glory in Death is fixed at 1.75 and it's unaffected by attack speed slows/buffs for the duration.\n Buffs that allow for the normal 2.5 attack speed cap to be broken, such as  Lethal Tempo and  Hail of Blades, will also break the upper limit of the 1.75 cap, but not the lower one. This means that while these buffs are active, Sion can exceed 1.75 attack speed, but cannot fall below it.\n After the effect ends, the attack speed cap will not revert to 1.75 but to 2.5. However Sion will still not be able to go below 1.75 attack speed.\n\n Buffs from jungle monsters Sion gains during Glory in Death ( Crest of Cinders,  Crest of Insight) will not be lost once the duration ends.\n By surviving for the full duration of 60 seconds, Sion will suffer 36.4k \u2212 345.5k (based on level) self-damage.\n After Glory in Death ends, the corpse of Sion will retain body block despite being dead on the ground.\n Even though its visuals are present,  Dark Harvest can never be gained from Sion under the effect of Glory in Death.\n Sion cannot  Recall while under the effect of Glory in Death.\n The effect that heals Sion back to full health at the start of Glory in Death cannot be modified by  healing reductions and does not count towards the 'Damage Healed' statistic at the end of game lobby.",

For example, striking Sion with  Blinding Dart right before the effect ends will not cause him to be blinded when the charge or leap finishes.\n After starting the charge Sion's movement speed cannot be artificially changed.\n\n After reaching maximum damage and stun duration (at 3 seconds) Sion will transition from using his haste animation to his unique charging one.\n Reaching the threshold on  Mecha Zero Sion changes his particle effects instead, most notably the 'Boosters' behind the train.\n\n PENDING FOR TEST The maximum turning angle (per distance traveled) of the charge is constant. The turning radius is a constant value, estimated at roughly 2500 units.\n This is not true when starting at insanely high values of movement speed; Sion will be facing the direction of the cast in his idle animation and turn at a much lower rate based on the speed he started with until his speed returns to the usual 950 MS limit.\n That the turning angle is not based on time can easily be seen in practice when a Sion charges in-place due to bugs.\n\n Sion does not always crash with terrain immediately upon touching it, enabling the player to turn beyond his maximum turning angle.\n Casting the ability at point blank of a terrain will most often automatically change the charge's direction.\n This is not usually possible with player-generated terrain.\n\n Unstoppable Onslaught cannot charge through but can leap over player-created terrain (i.e  Crystallize).\n The charge will not collide with an allied  Emperor's Divide.\n\n PENDING FOR TEST The distance between Sion's center and the center of the ground slam scales slightly with movement speed. This is suspected because running into a wall within half a second of charge time after starting at multiple thousands of movement speed shows a considerable difference, however this could also be due to a bug.\n PENDING FOR TEST The leap appears to always have the same speed regardless of Sion's, at roughly 750.\n Hovering the cursor on the HUD (e.g minimap / champion portraits) does not affect the cast and steering of Unstoppable Onslaught.\n Even though the ability doesn't have a distance limit, casting the ability outside its cast range (7500 units), will have Sion attempt to walk in range before charging.\n Even though the cooldown of Unstoppable Onslaught starts at the end of the effect, gaining or losing CDR, or upgrading the ability during the effect, will not change the resuming cooldown.\n However, gaining  Presence of Mind's effect during Unstoppable Onslaught does result in a lowered cooldown.",
