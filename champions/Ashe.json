The time before being able to reactivate Ranger's Focus is 6.08 \u2212 1.6 (based on attack speed) seconds.\n The multi-attack effect is similar to  Lightslinger and  Double Strike, except that on-hit effects aren't applied by the extra attacks.\n Each arrow from a flurry applies  Frost and the bonus damage from  Frost Shot is calculated individually per arrow.\n Similarly, since a flurry is 5 instances of physical damage,  The Black Cleaver allows her to cleave the enemy target 5 times per flurry.\n  Amumu's  Tantrum will reduce each arrow's damage, for a total of 10 \u2212 50 (based on E Rank) per flurry.\n\n Each additional arrow from  Runaan's Hurricane will also split into 5 arrows.\n The arrows are evenly distributed among secondary enemies but one enemy cannot be hit by more than 5 arrows.\n The flurry will trigger on-hit effects once to each enemy hit.\n Wind's Fury's splash damage is affected by the damage modifier of Ranger's Focus Rank 1 and doesn't increase based on its Rank - always dealing[ (8.4% AD) damage per arrow ][ (42% AD) damage per flurry ]to each secondary target.\n\n The Flurry attack can be used on structures.",

The entire effect is classified as a basic attack on a script-level, which disables  Ravenous Hunter, but is considered an ability for other effects (i.e  Sap Magic), which is likely due to a mistaken script-level tag.\n Although Ranger's Focus has no actual cooldown, 4 stacks of focus are needed before Ranger's Focus can be reactivated. The time before being able to reactivate Ranger's Focus is 6.08 \u2212 1.6 (based on attack speed) seconds.\n The multi-attack effect is similar to  Lightslinger and  Double Strike, except that on-hit effects aren't applied by the extra attacks.\n Each arrow from a flurry applies  Frost and the bonus damage from  Frost Shot is calculated individually per arrow.\n Similarly, since a flurry is 5 instances of physical damage,  The Black Cleaver allows her to cleave the enemy target 5 times per flurry.\n  Amumu's  Tantrum will reduce each arrow's damage, for a total of 10 \u2212 50 (based on E Rank) per flurry.\n\n Each additional arrow from  Runaan's Hurricane will also split into 5 arrows.\n The arrows are evenly distributed among secondary enemies but one enemy cannot be hit by more than 5 arrows.\n The flurry will trigger on-hit effects once to each enemy hit.\n Wind's Fury's splash damage is affected by the damage modifier of Ranger's Focus Rank 1 and doesn't increase based on its Rank - always dealing[ (8.4% AD) damage per arrow ][ (42% AD) damage per flurry ]to each secondary target.\n\n The Flurry attack can be used on structures.",
